# How Run Project
The procedures are,

Initial Step is download & import the project from VS Code IDE/Android studio.
After that change app name & some other customization as your wish. (Itâ€™s optional not mandatory).
Then we need some library files for execute the project. So here use flutter pub get command for get external dependency files. Pub is the package manager.
Final step is flutter run
